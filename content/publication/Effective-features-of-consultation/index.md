abstract: Consultation is an integral part of many EPâ€™s work. However, there is a large range of ways in which it is used and 
  understood. This makes evaluating its efficacy difficult. My research therefore sought to identify what the effective features of 
  consultation are by linking observed features to changes in agreed outcomes for children and young people. Interviews with EPs and 
  observations of consultations were analysed and the features which were more likely to lead to change were identified.
