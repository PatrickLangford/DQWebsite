I am an Educational Psychologist working in Waltham Forest. I work with children and young people aged from 2-18-years-old across a wide range of settings. I also run the Emotional Literacy Support Assistant (ELSA) Programme in my borough. My thesis aimed to explore what makes consultation effective. Using a mixed methods approach (including interview and observations) the core features of consultation, which lead to real world change for children and young people, were identified. I have experience as a reproducibility checker for the journal Meta-Psychology. I also curate the scientific blog www.psychbrief.com where I explore and summarise psychology, statistics, and meta-science.
