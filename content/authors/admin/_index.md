I am a 3rd year Trainee Educational Psychology student at the Institute of Education, UCL. I have worked as a Trainee Educational Psychologist (TEP) with Enfield and Waltham Forest Educational Psychology Services (EPS). I have worked with children and young people aged from 2-18-years-old across a wide range of settings, including Pupil Referral Units. My thesis aims to explore what makes consultation effective. Using a mixed methods approach, including interview and observations, the core conditions and features of consultation which lead to real world change will be analysed.
