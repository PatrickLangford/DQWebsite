#abstract: My first year project involved sending a questionnaire to Waltham Forest and 
#  Enfield EPs to see how they define consultation and what they believe the main features
#  are. Initial child-level consultations were then audio-recorded and thematically 
#  analysed to see whether the most common features during a consultation matched what EPs   say they value.
