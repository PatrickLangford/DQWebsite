abstract: I summarised the seminal paper 'False-Positive Psychology' by Simmons,
  Nelson, & Simonsohn for the journal club ReproducibiliTea. We then discussed how the
  paper affected our understanding of psychology, statitics, and open science, as well
  as thinking about how to improve scientific practices in the future.
